//! Cross-profile branch coverage for `%if` / `%ifarch` / `%ifos`
//! conditionals.
//!
//! Walks every conditional in the parsed spec, evaluates each branch
//! against every member profile of a [`ResolvedTargetSet`], and
//! reports which profiles see the branch active. The report drives
//! `matrix coverage` — release engineers use it to spot dead
//! branches, distro-only branches, and conditions the analyzer
//! couldn't evaluate.
//!
//! Phase 1 evaluator scope:
//!
//! * `%ifarch` / `%ifnarch` — strict equality of any list entry
//!   against [`ArchInfo::build_arch`]. Handles bare names and
//!   `%{macro}` arches (the macro is expanded via the profile's
//!   registry before comparison).
//! * `%ifos` / `%ifnos` — same, against [`ArchInfo::build_os`].
//! * `%if EXPR` — best-effort numeric evaluation. Macros are
//!   expanded through [`MacroRegistry::expand_to_literal`]; the
//!   resulting text is parsed as `i64` (non-zero ⇒ active). When
//!   any sub-expression can't be resolved (undefined macro,
//!   non-numeric body, string compare, …) the branch is reported
//!   as [`BranchActivity::Indeterminate`] rather than guessing.
//!
//! Limitations are intentional: a full RPM expression evaluator
//! is a separate project. The "indeterminate" classification is
//! load-bearing — it tells the user "this needs human review", not
//! "this branch is dead".
